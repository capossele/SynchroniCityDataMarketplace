Overview
========

This project is part of the EU H2020 `SynchroniCity <https://synchronicity-iot.eu>`__ project and it is based on the `FIWARE Business API Ecosystem <https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/business-api-ecosystem-biz-ecosystem-ri>`__.

The `SynchroniCity IoT Data Marketplace <https://github.com/caposseleDigicat/SynchroniCityDataMarketplace>`__ is a joint component made up of the FIWARE Business Framework and a set of APIs (and its
reference implementations) provided by the TMForum. This component allows the monetization of different kind of assets
(both digital and physical) during the whole service life cycle, from offering creation to its charging, accounting
and revenue settlement and sharing. The SynchroniCity IoT Data Marketplace exposes its complete functionality through TMForum
standard APIs; concretely, it includes the catalog management, ordering management, inventory management,
usage management, billing, customer, and party APIs.

The SynchroniCity IoT Data Marketplace is not a single software repository, but it is composed of different projects which
work coordinately to provide the complete functionality.

Concretely, the SynchroniCity IoT Data Marketplace is made of the following components:

* *Reference implementations of TM Forum APIs*: Reference implementation of the catalog management, ordering management, inventory management, usage management, billing, customer, and party APIs.
* *Business Ecosystem Charging Backend*: Is the component in charge of processing the different pricing models, the accounting information, and the revenue sharing reports. With this information, the Business Ecosystem Charging Backend is able to calculate amounts to be charged, charge customers, and pay sellers.
* *Business Ecosystem RSS*: Is in charge of distributing the revenues originated by the usage of a given data source among the involved stakeholders. In particular, it focuses on distributing part of the revenue generated by a data source between the SynchroniCity IoT Data Marketplace instance provider and the Data Provider(s) responsible for the data source. 
* *Business Ecosystem Logic Proxy*: Acts as the endpoint for accessing the SynchroniCity IoT Data Marketplace. On the one hand, it orchestrates the APIs validating user requests, including authentication, authorization, and the content of the request from a business logic point of view. On the other hand, it serves a web portal that can be used to interact with the system.
